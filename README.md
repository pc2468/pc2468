# Hey, Iâ€™m Prathamesh  

I spend most of my time convincing computers to simulate things the universe already does for free â€” gravity, spacetime, the occasional black hole.  

- Studying physics and chasing simulations that bend reality (numerical relativity, cosmology, HPC)  
- Linux is home (yes, Arch â€” I like my suffering customized)  
- Python for fast ideas, C++ for when fast actually matters  
- LaTeX because plain text just isnâ€™t dramatic enough for equations
